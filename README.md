Compare My Dinner
=================

A simple app that compares what you eat in terms of calories, carbs, sodium, etc.

An user can search for up to two dishes and compare them. The app will highlight the biggest in calories, carbs, sodium, etc but will not make any recommendation.

We will be using the Fat Secret API: http://platform.fatsecret.com/api/

Some other ideas that occurred to me:

- Leverage SAPI so the user can track calories around places they usually eat
- Maintain a history of searches
- Count the amount of calories, carbs, sodium, etc consumed overtime (like a report page)
- Give the user the ability to Tweet what and where they are eating (we may need SAPI)
- Give the user the ability to Check In on both Facebook and Foursquare where they are eating
